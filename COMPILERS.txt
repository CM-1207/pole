Borland C++ Compiler 5.5.1
------------------------------
The command-line Borland C++ Compiler version 5.5.1 is available for free 
(as 'free' in 'free beer') from:
http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html

OpenWatcom 1.3
------------------------------
OpenWatcom 1.3 does not have STL implementation, therefore you need to 
install STLport (tested with version 4.6, earlier version may or may not 
work).  Because mainstream STLport can not be used directly with OpenWatcom,
please download and use the patched version from this site:

Digital Mars 8.41n
-------------------------------
Digital Mars command-line C/C++ compilers are available for download 
from http://www.digitalmars.com. STLport is required and must be 
installed as well.
